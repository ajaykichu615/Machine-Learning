Linear Regression
-----------------

Linear regression is a simple way of predicting a value (like price, temperature, or weight) based on one or more inputs (features). It draws a straight line (or a plane in more dimensions) that best fits the data points.


Formula : y=mx+c

Where:

y = predicted output (like Sales)

x = input feature (like Temperature)

m = slope of the line (how much y changes when x increases)

c = intercept (where the line crosses y-axis)

The model tries to find the best m (slope) and b (intercept) so that the predicted values (yÌ‚) are as close as possible to the actual values (y).


Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a method used in linear regression to estimate the parameters (coefficients) of a model that best fits the data. OLS helps us find the best values of m and c so that the line fits the data as well as possible.
