# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains my collection of machine learning projects and practice notebooks created as part of my learning journey.  

It covers a variety of topics such as:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Supervised learning (classification, regression)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Natural Language Processing (text classification, vectorization)
- Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
- Deployment experiments using tools like Gradio  

The projects range from small experiments to more complete end-to-end workflows.  
This repository is meant for learning, experimentation, and tracking my progress in ML.
