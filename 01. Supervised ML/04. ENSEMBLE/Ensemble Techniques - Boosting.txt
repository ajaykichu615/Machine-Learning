How Boosting Works (Step-by-Step):

1. Train a weak model (e.g., a small decision tree) on the full data.

2. Check where it went wrong (misclassified or high error).

3. Give more weight to those wrong points.

4. Train the next model to focus on those errors.

5. Repeat this process for several rounds.

6. Combine all models to make a strong final model.
