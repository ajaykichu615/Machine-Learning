Steps of K-Means Algorithm:

1. Choose the number of clusters (K)

You decide how many groups (K) you want to find.


2. Initialize K centroids randomly

A centroid is like the "center" of a cluster. Pick K random data points as initial centroids.


3. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid

Use distance (usually Euclidean distance) to find which centroid is closest to each point.


4. Update the centroids

For each cluster, compute the average (mean) of all points in that cluster.

Move the centroid to this new average point.


5. Repeat steps 3 and 4

Keep assigning points and updating centroids until:

The centroids stop changing (or)

A maximum number of iterations is reached

üîÅ Example

Imagine 2D data of students‚Äô marks in Math and Science:

Student	Math	Science

A	90	95
B	88	92
C	30	40
D	35	38


If we choose K = 2, the algorithm might cluster:

Group 1: High scorers (A, B)

Group 2: Low scorers (C, D)

üìà Visual Intuition:

1. Plot all data points on a graph.


2. Place K dots (centroids) at random locations.


3. Color points based on their nearest centroid.


4. Move centroids to the center of their groups.


5. Repeat until centroids stop¬†moving.

Elbow method - to find Optimal K:

We calculate inertia (sum of squared distances of samples to their closest cluster center) for different values of K.

When K increases, inertia always decreases (more clusters = closer points).

But after a point, the gain is not significant.

That point is the "elbow" ‚Äî where the curve bends.

Choose K at the elbow.
