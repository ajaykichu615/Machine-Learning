NLP (Natural Language Processing)
---------------------------------

1. Count Vectorizer

Turns text into numbers.
Counts words in documents.
Create a bag of words by measuring word occurrence frequency,


I played Football. I usually plays football.
She played cricket.
They are playing both cricket and football.


play football cricket 
 2     2         0
 1     0         1
 1     1         1



Steps in text preprocessing:
---------------------------

1. Lowercasing
2. Removing punctuation
3. Stop word removal - remove common words like 'is', 'the, 'and' etc.
4. Tokenization - split text into words or tokens
5. Stemming and Lemmatization (Text normalization) - Reduce words to their root form or base form. 'playing'----> 'play'
	
	Stemming: When speed is prioritized or for simple normalization (large-scale search, quick indexing).

	Lemmatization: When linguistic accuracy matters, or for advanced tasks like information retrieval, sentiment 	analysis, translation, and chatbots.



2. Tf-idf
