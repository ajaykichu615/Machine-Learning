Evaluation Metrics for regression problems
------------------------------------------

Mean Absolute Error - Measures the average size of the errors in a set of predictions.

Takes the absolute value (no negatives). Gives equal weight to small and big errors.  Closer to 0 is better


Mean Squared Error - Measures the average of squared errors.

Larger errors become much bigger (because of squaring).Sensitive to outliers. Closer to 0 is better


Root Mean Squared Error - Just the square root of MSE. Same as MSE, but more interpretable (because it's in the same units as your target).  closer to 0 is better


R squared value ( 1---> Perfect fit, 0--->Worst fit)
= 1-(SSres/SStotal)    ( SSres ---Square Sum of residuals | SStotal ----Squared Sum of Total)

r2 = 1- Model Errors/ Total Variance in Data

​Tells you how well your model explains the data.

It’s like a percentage of "how much sense" your predictions make.
Best case: 1.0

Acceptable: Between 0 and 1

Bad: Less than 0
