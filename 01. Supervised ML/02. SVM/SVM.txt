🧠 SVM Algorithm

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression, but it is mainly used for classification.

SVM aims to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space (where N is the number of features) that best separates the data into classes.

---
✳️ How It Works:

1. It finds the optimal hyperplane that separates the classes with the maximum margin.

2. Support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the hyperplane. These are the key elements of the training dataset.

3. If the data is not linearly separable, SVM uses kernel functions to map data into a higher dimension where separation is possible.

🔧 Types of Kernel Functions (for non-linear classification):

* Linear – for linearly separable data

* Polynomial – when relationships are curved

* RBF (Radial Basis Function) – for complex, non-linear data

* Sigmoid – similar to neural networks

✅ Advantages of SVM:

1. Effective in high-dimensional spaces – Works well even when number of features > number of samples.

2. Memory efficient – Uses only support vectors for decision function.

3. Versatile – Can be used for linear and non-linear data with different kernels.

4. Robust to overfitting (especially with proper regularization).

5. Works well with clear margin of separation between classes.

❌ Disadvantages of SVM:

1. Not suitable for large datasets – Training time increases with the size of the dataset.

2. Poor performance on overlapping classes – SVM doesn’t perform well when the classes are heavily mixed or not well-separated.

3. Hard to tune – Choosing the right kernel and parameters (like C and gamma) can be tricky.

4. No direct probability estimates – Unlike some other classifiers, SVM doesn’t directly provide probability scores (unless explicitly modified).

5. Less interpretable – It’s harder to understand the model when using complex kernels.
