Polynomial Regression
---------------------

When the data shows a non-linear relationships, we use curve-like model instead of linear model by
using Polynomial Regression. It is a type of regression technique that models the relationship between the 
independent and dependent variable as an nth degree polynomial. It is an extension of Linear Regression,
where instead of fitting a straight line, we fit a curve.
