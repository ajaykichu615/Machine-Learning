Naive Bayes Algorithm
----------------------

- Supervised ML Algorithm only used for classification.

- It is a probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes theorem.

- The 'naive' part comes from its assumption of feature of feature independence, meaning it assumes the presence of one feature
  doesn't affect the presence of another within a specific class.

- Mainly used for text classification problem.

- Parametric algorithm

Based on features, 3 types:
1. GaussianNB----> Continuous feature values
2. MultiNomial----> Discreet feature values
3. Bernoulli---->  feature values
